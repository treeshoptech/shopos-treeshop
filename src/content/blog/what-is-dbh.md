When we quote land clearing, the first thing we ask is: **"What's the largest tree diameter you need cleared?"**

This isn't random. DBH is the single most important factor in calculating how long a job will take – and therefore what it costs.

## What DBH Means

**DBH = Diameter at Breast Height**

It's measured 4.5 feet above ground level. This is the standard forestry measurement used worldwide.

### Why 4.5 Feet?

1. Consistent measurement point (above most root flare)
2. Easy to reach without bending
3. Represents the main trunk, not buttress

### How to Measure

Wrap a tape measure around the tree at 4.5 feet. Divide by π (3.14159) to get diameter.

Or simpler: Use a DBH tape that reads diameter directly.

**Quick estimate:** Wrap your arms around the tree. If your fingers touch, it's roughly 6-8". If not, probably 10"+.

## Why DBH Matters for Clearing

Larger trees take exponentially more time to mulch:

| DBH | Relative Difficulty |
|-----|---------------------|
| 4" | 1× (baseline) |
| 6" | 1.5× |
| 8" | 2× |
| 10" | 2.5× |
| 12" | 3× |
| 15" | 4× |

A 12" tree doesn't take twice as long as a 6" tree – it takes **three times** as long. More wood, more passes, more wear on equipment.

## Our DBH Package System

Instead of measuring every tree on your property, we use packages:

| Package | Description | You Have If... |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| 2" | Brush only | No actual trees |
| 4" | Saplings | Young growth, thin trunks |
| 6" | Young trees | Arms wrap easily |
| 8" | Established | Standard lot trees |
| 10" | Mature | Need two people to hug |
| 12" | Large | 25+ year old trees |
| 15" | Heritage | Old growth, hardwoods |

**You pick the package that covers your LARGEST tree.** Smaller trees are included.

## The Formula

Once we know DBH and acres:
```
MulchingScore = DBH × Acres
Hours = Score ÷ 2.0 PPH
Cost = Hours × $475/hr
```

**Example:**
5 acres with trees up to 8" DBH:

- Score: 8 × 5 = 40
- Hours: 40 ÷ 2.0 = 20 hours
- Cost: 20 × $475 = $9,500
