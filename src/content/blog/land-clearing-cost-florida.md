If you've ever called around for land clearing quotes in Florida, you've probably gotten wildly different numbers. One company says $2,000. Another says $8,000. A third won't quote without a site visit.

**Here's why:** Most contractors are guessing.

At TreeShop, we've spent 16 years refining a score-based pricing system that eliminates guesswork. Let me show you exactly how we calculate land clearing costs.

## The MulchingScore Formula

Every forestry mulching job starts with two numbers:

1. **Acres** – How much land?
2. **DBH Package** – What's the largest tree diameter you need cleared?

The formula:
```
MulchingScore = DBH × Acres
Production Hours = Score ÷ 2.0 PPH
Cost = Hours × $475/hr + Transport
```

## Real Examples

**2 acres with 8" DBH (established trees):**

- Score: 8 × 2 = 16
- Hours: 16 ÷ 2.0 = 8 hours
- Cost: 8 × $475 = $3,800
- Add transport (~$375 from NSB)
- **Total: ~$4,175**

**5 acres with 6" DBH (young growth):**

- Score: 6 × 5 = 30
- Hours: 30 ÷ 2.0 = 15 hours
- Cost: 15 × $475 = $7,125
- **Total: ~$7,500 with transport**

## What Affects the Price?

### DBH Packages

DBH (Diameter at Breast Height) is the standard forestry measurement. We use 7 packages:

| Package | Description | Typical Use |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| 2" | Brush only | Overgrown lawns |
| 4" | Saplings | Light understory |
| 6" | Young trees | Most common |
| 8" | Established trees | Standard forest |
| 10" | Mature trees | Heavy vegetation |
| 12" | Large trees | Dense hardwood |
| 15" | Heritage/old growth | Extreme density |

### Project Factors

Some conditions add time:

- Invasive palmetto: +12-30%
- Steep slopes: +8-15%
- Limited access: +6-25%
- Wet conditions: +12-18%

## Why This Works

When you know the formula, there's no mystery. You can calculate your own estimate before we even visit.
