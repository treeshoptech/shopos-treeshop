I'll be direct: **French drains in Florida have an expiration date.**

In our sandy, high-water-table soil, the average French drain lasts 5-10 years before it clogs completely. I've dug up hundreds of them. The story is always the same.

## Why French Drains Fail

### 1. The Fabric Trap

Traditional French drains use landscape fabric wrapped around perforated pipe and gravel. The idea is to keep soil out while letting water in.

**The problem:** Florida's fine sandy soil particles are smaller than the fabric pores. They pass through, accumulate in the gravel, and eventually form an impermeable layer.

It's not a matter of *if* – it's *when*.

### 2. Root Invasion

Florida vegetation is aggressive. Oak roots, palm roots, and especially shrub roots seek water. Your French drain is a water highway. Roots find it, infiltrate through fabric seams, and clog the pipe.

### 3. Sediment Accumulation

Every rain event washes fine particles into your drain. Without a way to flush them, they settle. Layer by layer, year by year, your drain capacity decreases until it's essentially a buried pipe full of mud.

## The Warning Signs

Your French drain is failing if you see:
- Standing water returning after rain
- Drain working slower than before
- Water pooling at inlet locations
- Soggy ground over the drain line
- Yard flooding that wasn't happening before

## What Actually Works: FreedomDrains

We switched to **HydroBlox** technology for all drainage installations. Here's why:

### No Fabric, No Clog

HydroBlox panels are made of engineered plastic with large internal channels. Water flows through freely. Sediment can't accumulate because there's no gravel matrix to trap it.

### Self-Maintaining

The panel design actually promotes water flow that flushes particles through. It's physics, not wishful thinking.

### Lifetime Guarantee

We guarantee FreedomDrains won't clog. Ever. Because the technology doesn't allow it.

## Cost Comparison

| Factor | French Drain | FreedomDrains |
|--------|--------------|---------------|
| Initial cost | $20-35/LF | $30-60/LF |
| Lifespan | 5-10 years | Lifetime |
| Maintenance | Needed | None |
| Replacement | $20-35/LF again | Never |
| 25-year cost | $60-105/LF | $30-60/LF |

**Over 25 years, FreedomDrains cost half as much.**
