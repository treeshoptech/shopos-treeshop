When it's time to clear land, you've got options. Let me break down the four main methods and when each makes sense.

## The Four Methods

### 1. Forestry Mulching

**How it works:** A single machine with a rotating drum mulches trees, brush, and vegetation into chips that stay on the ground.

**Best for:**
- Properties up to 15" DBH (diameter)
- Erosion control is important
- You want to preserve topsoil
- Single-pass clearing

**Pros:**
- One machine, one operator
- Mulch stays as ground cover
- No burning, no hauling
- Minimal soil disturbance

**Cons:**
- Can't handle trees over 15"
- Mulch layer remains (some don't want this)
- Not for stump removal

**Typical cost:** $475/hour (TreeShop rate)

### 2. Traditional Bulldozing

**How it works:** Bulldozer pushes over trees, piles debris for burning or hauling.

**Best for:**
- Large trees (16"+)
- Complete site leveling needed
- Burn permits available
- Budget isn't primary concern

**Pros:**
- Handles any size tree
- Complete removal

**Cons:**
- Destroys topsoil
- Requires burn pile management
- Multiple machines needed
- Higher erosion risk

**Typical cost:** $750-1,200/hour with debris handling

### 3. Excavation

**How it works:** Excavator removes trees with root balls, hauls off-site.

**Best for:**
- Tree preservation (transplanting)
- Root ball removal required
- Construction sites needing deep clearing

**Pros:**
- Complete removal including roots
- Can transplant valuable trees

**Cons:**
- Expensive hauling
- Large equipment footprint
- Soil compaction

**Typical cost:** $1,000-2,000/hour plus hauling

### 4. Hand Clearing

**How it works:** Crew with chainsaws cuts trees, stacks for removal.

**Best for:**
- Selective thinning
- Tight access areas
- Small quantities
- Specimen tree preservation

**Pros:**
- Precision control
- Minimal equipment damage
- Works anywhere

**Cons:**
- Labor intensive
- Slow for large areas
- Still need debris solution

**Typical cost:** $50-100/tree plus debris

## The Decision Matrix

| Factor | Forestry Mulching | Bulldozing | Excavation | Hand Clearing |
|--------|-------------------|------------|------------|---------------|
| Speed | ★★★★★ | ★★★★ | ★★★ | ★★ |
| Cost | ★★★★ | ★★★ | ★★ | ★★★ |
| Soil Impact | ★★★★★ | ★★ | ★★ | ★★★★ |
| Tree Size | Up to 15" | Any | Any | Any |
| Debris | Stays as mulch | Burn/haul | Haul | Haul |

## When to Choose Forestry Mulching

For 90% of residential and commercial clearing in Florida, forestry mulching is the answer:

- **Faster**: One machine does it all
- **Cheaper**: No hauling, no burning
- **Better for soil**: Mulch prevents erosion
- **Eco-friendly**: Nutrients return to soil

The only times we recommend traditional methods:
1. Trees larger than 15" diameter
2. Client specifically wants bare dirt
3. Deep stump removal required for foundations
