I've been in the tree service industry for 16 years. In that time, I've watched countless competitors start, struggle, and disappear.

The statistics back this up: **82% of tree service businesses fail within 5 years.**

Not 50%. Not 60%. Eighty-two percent.

That means if you look at 10 new tree service trucks on the road today, only 2 will still be operating in 2030.

## Why They Fail

After watching this pattern repeat for nearly two decades, I've identified the three killers:

### 1. Gut-Feel Pricing

Most operators price by "what feels right" or "what the last guy charged." They don't know their actual costs. They don't track production rates. They don't factor in equipment wear.

When a job goes bad, they don't know why. When business slows, they drop prices to compete – digging the hole deeper.

### 2. Owner as Single Point of Failure

The owner runs every job. The owner handles every call. The owner makes every decision. There's no system, no process, no documentation.

When the owner gets sick, business stops. When the owner wants time off, there's no one to cover. When the owner wants to scale, there's nothing to scale.

### 3. No Cash Reserves

Equipment breaks. Weather cancels jobs. Customers pay late. Economic downturns hit.

Without 3-6 months of operating capital, one bad month can cascade into bankruptcy. Most operators are living job-to-job.

## What Survivors Do Differently

The 18% that make it share common traits:

### Systematic Pricing

They know their exact costs:
- Equipment: $/hour for every machine
- Labor: Fully loaded cost per crew hour
- Overhead: Insurance, trucks, office, marketing

They price to hit 50% margins, not survive at 15%.

### Documented Processes

Anyone can answer the phone using the same script. Any crew can execute the same process. The business runs on systems, not heroics.

### Financial Discipline

They have cash reserves. They review financials monthly. They know their numbers cold.

## The TreeShop Approach

After 500+ jobs, we've systematized everything:

**Pricing:** Score-based formulas (MulchingScore, StumpScore, TreeScore) that eliminate guessing. Every quote uses the same math.

**Operations:** Documented processes for quoting, scheduling, production, and follow-up. We train to the system.

**Equipment:** Army Corps of Engineers methodology for true hourly costs. We know exactly what every machine costs to run.

**Financial:** Weekly reviews, monthly close, quarterly planning. We see problems before they become crises.

This isn't theory. It's 16 years of trial and error, refined into a system that works.

## For Operators

If you're running a tree service and want to be in the 18%:

**Step 1:** Know your true equipment costs. Not "about $50/hour." The real number.

**Step 2:** Build a pricing formula. Stop guessing.

**Step 3:** Document one process this week. Then another. Then another.

**Step 4:** Check your cash. Do you have 3 months of operating capital?

Or, if you want to shortcut the learning curve...
