You call for a land clearing quote. You describe your property: "About 2 acres, some small trees, nothing major."

We visit. We see your "nothing major" is actually **dense saw palmetto** covering 80% of the lot.

Your quote just went up 30%.

## What Is Saw Palmetto?

If you're not from Florida, you might not recognize it. But if you've ever tried to walk through undeveloped Florida land, you know it instantly.

**Saw palmetto** (Serenoa repens) is a low-growing palm with sharp, tooth-edged fronds. It grows in dense clusters, creating an impenetrable thicket 3-6 feet high.

It's the dominant understory plant across most of Florida.

## Why It's Expensive to Clear

### 1. Fiber Content

Palmetto fronds are fibrous. Not woody like trees. **Fibrous**.

When your mulcher processes a 6" oak tree, it cuts clean. When it hits palmetto, the fibers wrap around the cutting teeth, bog down the drum, and force you to slow to a crawl.

Production rate on pine/oak: **2.0 PPH** (Points Per Hour)

Production rate on heavy palmetto: **1.5 PPH or worse**

That's a 30%+ time increase.

### 2. Density

Palmetto doesn't grow as individual plants. It spreads via rhizomes (underground stems), forming colonies. A "single" palmetto patch might actually be one massive organism covering half an acre.

To mulch it effectively, you're processing **tons** of biomass per acre – far more than you'd see with just trees.

### 3. Root System

Unlike trees that you mulch and they're gone, palmetto roots remain viable underground. If you don't grind deep enough, they'll resprout.

Proper clearing requires taking the crowns down below grade, which adds passes.

## How We Factor It

When we quote jobs with palmetto, we use Project Factors:

- **Standard palmetto presence**: +12% to base score
- **Invasive palmetto density**: +30% to base score

These aren't arbitrary. They're based on 500+ jobs tracking actual production rates.

### Example

2 acres, 6" DBH package, heavy palmetto:

**Without palmetto:**
- Score: 6 × 2 = 12
- Hours: 12 ÷ 2.0 = 6 hours
- Cost: 6 × $475 = $2,850

**With heavy palmetto** (+30%):
- Factored Score: 12 × 1.30 = 15.6
- Hours: 15.6 ÷ 2.0 = 7.8 hours
- Cost: 7.8 × $475 = $3,705

**Difference: $855**

That's real. That's what it takes to clear it properly.

## Other Problem Vegetation

Palmetto isn't alone. Florida has other nightmares:

**Brazilian Pepper** (+25%): Invasive hardwood that spreads aggressively. Thick trunks, dense canopy, endless root sprouts.

**Bamboo** (+35%): If you've got bamboo, I'm sorry. It's the worst. Rhizomes spread underground for hundreds of feet. Mulching it is like fighting hydra.

**Smilax (Greenbrier) Vines** (+18%): Thorny vines that tangle equipment. Have to stop repeatedly to clear the drum.

## Identifying Palmetto on Your Property

Not sure if you have it? Look for:

- Fan-shaped fronds with spiny edges
- Grows in thickets 3-6 feet tall
- Often under pine trees
- Covers ground densely
- Yellowish-green color

If you see this across your lot, factor it into your expectations.
